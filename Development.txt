This file is reserved for itemize the features to develop for the library.

List of current features to develop:
	* Implementation of a scalable data structure to hold intermediate results;
	* Enhance the multithread measurements support for easier user interaction;
	* Provide more statistics:
		* Per thread and global outputs;
		* Median calculation;
		* Standard deviation calculation;
	* Receive a list of counters to measure:
		* Creating event sets;
		* Handling conflicts;
		* Later measuring only the available counters;
	* Receive the function to test and number of runs per counter:
		* Automatically executing all measurements;
	* Receive a functor to profile;
	* General improvement of code;
	* Implement CSV output;
	* Compile with CMake.

Technical requirements:
	* If counters conflict it always creates a new event - fix it!;
	* Class for error management (including I/O information);
	* PAL will be a namespace;
	* Add multiplexing;
	* Add Doxygen documentation;
	* Add multithread support;

Estado: fazer repeticoes das medicoes de cada evento; start e stop apenas funcam para 1 counter por eventset
